Studo Clone with limited features

since I am tired of finding studo codes and I only use the calendar and mail function anyways I wanted to try and create a studo clone with these features. 
As an additional Feature this app should have a To-Do-List that partly generates out of the calendar. 

I want to use Kotlin as the programming language, since from my understanding it is the standard for Android apps. 
For the IDE I will work with android Studio.
For managing the project workflow I will use a Kanban Board on Jira, since I don't want to have sprints but instead have all of my tasks visualised and pick and choose what I want to work on at any given day.
